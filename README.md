The purpose of this was to update deployed code in terms of semantics and readability rather than change the visuals of the page itself. The changes are listed below.

Changes:
Website title updated to company name to be more descriptive of the purpose of the site.

Navigation semantic and simplification of the class for navigation and the unordered list rather than separating these out.

Sections rather than 'div' were leveraged to separate out each part.

Repetitive classes in the style.css were updated to avoid duplication of effort when making changes and to more logically group elements on the webpage. This will mean for instance if a new 'offering' from this company was added, the same styles could be easily applied.

Updated all images to have alt attributes to ensure this appears if any errors in rendering image for viewer.

Leveraged 'aside' semantic for benefits section to display content on the side of the page.

Flow of index html code is logical based on page.

Flow of CSS classes are more logical and aligned to html page therefore easier to follow.

Footer header updated to h4 rather than repeat of h2.
